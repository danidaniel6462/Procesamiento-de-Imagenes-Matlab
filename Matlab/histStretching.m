    % H, could have bins with 0 counts. The problem is that, in the next step, weâ€™ll be doing an inverse look-up, which means that we need an invertible function. If H has zeros, then cumsum(H) will have at least two identical values and will not be invertible. Setting the zero-count values in H to eps(sum(H)) ensures that H does not have non-zero values but only has a trivial effect on the CDF
